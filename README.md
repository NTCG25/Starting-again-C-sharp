# Starting-again-C-sharp

1st Project - This project on starting again C# is figuring out the gamestage for a game me and my friends played. To figure out this gamestage there is a formula (Days Alive + Level) * 1.2. I converted this into a C# program that has the user input their levels and days alive and once they put that it will multiply it by 1.2 to give them thier gamestage number.
